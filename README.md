# Notes — a local-first notebook for GitHub Pages

A privacy-first, offline-capable notes app. No build step, no server, no
account. Clone it, turn on GitHub Pages, and it's yours.

## Get it running (under 5 minutes)

1. **Clone or fork this repository.**
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: repo Settings → Pages → Source → "Deploy from a
   branch" → pick `main` and `/ (root)` → Save.
3. Open `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`. That's it — you
   have a private notes app. Nothing is sent anywhere until you choose to
   sync or share.
4. Optional: tap **Install** in your browser's address bar (or "Add to Home
   Screen" on mobile) to use it like a native app, offline.

## What works today (Phase 1)

- Create, edit, pin, archive, and soft-delete notes
- Folders and tags, with quick filtering
- Markdown editor with live preview
- Instant full-text search
- Light / dark / system theme
- Full offline support once loaded (installable PWA)
- Export all notes as JSON, export a single note as `.md`
- Import from a JSON export

## GitHub sync (Phase 2, included)

Open **GitHub sync** in the sidebar and provide:

- A **Fine-grained Personal Access Token** scoped to *this one repository*,
  with **Contents: Read & Write** and **Metadata: Read** permissions —
  nothing more. Create one at
  `github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new`.
- The repo owner, repo name, and the path notes should live under
  (defaults to `notes/`).

**Save to GitHub** commits every note as a Markdown file with front-matter
in a single atomic commit (via the Git Data API — not one request per
file). **Pull from GitHub** reads that folder back in. The token never
leaves your browser except to talk to `api.github.com`.

## What's not built yet

- **WebRTC same-Wi-Fi sharing** (Phase 3) and the **Markdown ZIP
  export/drag-and-drop** (Phase 4) are on the roadmap in
  `NOTES-APP-REQUIREMENTS.md` but not implemented in this pass.
- Conflict handling is last-write-wins only — there's no merge UI. If you
  edit the same note from two devices before syncing, the later save wins.

## A note on data durability

Your notes live in this browser's IndexedDB. That's normally durable, but
iOS Safari in particular can evict site data under storage pressure with no
warning. The app asks the browser to persist storage on first load, and
will nudge you to export or sync once you've built up a meaningful number
of notes — but **export regularly** (sidebar → "Export notes") if these
notes matter to you.
